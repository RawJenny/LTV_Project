CUSTOMER INSIGHTS & LIFETIME VALUE ANALYSIS FOR DIGITAL WALLETS USERS
This report analyzes digital wallet user data from a financial technology platform. It focuses on identifying high-value customer segments, payment behavior trends, and key factors driving Lifetime Value (LTV) across different demographics and behavioral dimensions.
Objective of the Project
To uncover insights from customer LTV data that inform user engagement, product strategy, and revenue optimization in digital wallet applications.
Problem Being Addressed
FinTech platforms face challenges in customer retention and monetization. This analysis aims to pinpoint the most valuable customer segments and understand behavioral and demographic factors that influence LTV, helping decision-makers enhance user lifetime value and satisfaction.

Key Datasets and Methodologies
•	Datasets: Digital wallet transaction logs, demographic attributes, usage patterns, and customer satisfaction data.
•	Methodologies: Excel-based tools including Pivot Tables, bar/line/pie charts, conditional formatting, and SUMIFS calculations for aggregating and filtering customer data.

Story of Data
Data Source
Internal digital wallet application logs and customer support systems.
Data Collection Process
Automated collection via in-app tracking and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
Data Structure
•	Rows: Represent individual customers
•	Columns: Include age, location, income level, payment method, transactions, cashback, support interactions, and LTV.
Important Features and Their Significance
•	LTV: Central revenue metric; total projected value from each customer.
•	Age & Income: Key segmentation attributes for targeted marketing.
•	Payment Method: Indicates customer behavior and preference.
•	App Usage & Cashback: Reflect engagement and retention incentives.
•	Support Tickets & Resolution Time: Service quality indicators tied to satisfaction.
Data Limitations or Biases
•	Lacks direct data on churn or inactive users.
•	Potential underrepresentation of infrequent users or multi-device usage.
•	Some behavioral attributes (e.g., sentiment or feedback) are qualitative and missing.

Data Splitting and Preprocessing
Data Cleaning
•	Removed duplicate customers and standardized date/transaction formats.
Handling Missing Values
•	Null values in categorical fields were excluded; numeric fields were imputed using means.
Data Transformations
•	Aggregated LTV by age, income, payment method, and app usage.
•	Converted categorical data into grouped formats for analysis (e.g., income levels, age bins).
Data Splitting
•	Dependent Variable: Lifetime Value (LTV)
•	Independent Variables: Age, Location, Income Level, Payment Method, Cashback, Transactions, App Usage, Referral Count

Industry Context
•	Sector: Financial Technology (Digital Payments)
•	Stakeholders: Product Managers, Data Analysts, Marketing Teams, UX Designers

Value to the Industry
•	Identifies high-value customer groups.
•	Optimizes customer engagement strategies.
•	Informs product design and loyalty programs.

Pre-Analysis
Key Trends
•	Suburban customers contribute the highest LTV (34% of total).
•	Middle-income users show the highest average LTV (~$1.25B).
•	UPI is the most lucrative payment method by total spend (~$8.89B).
•	Highest LTV age group: 36–45.
Potential Correlations
•	Frequent app users (weekly) receive more cashback.
•	High satisfaction correlates with low issue resolution time.
•	Referral counts align with LTV but peak at 20–29 then decline.
Initial Insights
•	LTV is driven more by behavior (usage, transactions) than age alone.
•	Satisfaction scores are critical for long-term value retention.

In-Analysis
Unconfirmed Insights
•	Does high loyalty point accumulation directly influence LTV?
•	Are older users (66–75) low-value due to app design or adoption barriers?
Recommendations
•	Double-down on middle-income and suburban users for upselling.
•	Enhance UPI experience — the top payment channel.
•	Target 36–55 age range — highest LTV group.
•	Offer cashback loyalty for weekly app users.
•	Improve support ticket resolution times to increase satisfaction and retention.
Analysis Techniques Used in Excel
•	Pivot Tables to group LTV by customer attributes.
•	Bar and Pie Charts for visual comparison.
•	Line Graphs to track LTV by referral activity.
•	Conditional formatting to identify high-LTV customers.

Post-Analysis and Insights
Key Findings
•	Best Payment Method: UPI
•	Highest LTV Location: Suburban
•	Top Income Level: Middle
•	Top Age Group by LTV: 36–45
•	Best App Usage Frequency: Weekly
•	Customer Satisfaction Average: 5.479
•	Total LTV: $969,557,983.60+
Comparison with Initial Findings
•	Initial trends were confirmed — middle-income, suburban, and UPI users offer the highest returns.
•	Surprisingly, credit and wallet balances were not far behind UPI in total spend.

Data Visualizations & Charts
Visuals Used
•	Bar Charts: Age Group vs LTV, Payment Method vs Total Spent
•	Pie Charts: LTV by Location, Income Level
•	Line Chart: LTV by Referral Count
•	Cards: Key KPIs (Best Payment Method, Total LTV, Satisfaction Score)
Explanation of Visualizations
•	Bar charts clearly depict top-performing age and payment groups.
•	Pie charts show proportional LTV distribution across demographics.
•	The referral line chart highlights where diminishing returns begin.

Recommendations and Observations
Actionable Insights
•	Focus on UPI users — refine features and rewards.
•	Promote loyalty bonuses for weekly active users.
•	Segment marketing toward 36–55-year-olds in middle-income, suburban regions.
•	Monitor referral campaigns to avoid saturation beyond 30 referrals.
Optimizations or Business Decisions
•	Personalized rewards for mid-income users.
•	Improve app UX for users aged 66+ to lift their LTV.
•	Reduce support delays to boost satisfaction and loyalty.
Unexpected Outcomes
•	Contrary to common assumptions, rural and urban areas contributed equally (33% each), suggesting untapped suburban dominance.

Conclusion
Key Learnings
•	Behavioral metrics like app usage and referrals strongly affect LTV.
•	Middle-income, suburban, UPI users between 36–55 form the most profitable demographic.
•	Support speed and cashback drive engagement.
Limitations
•	No data on churn or inactive user behavior.
•	No longitudinal data to calculate full Customer Lifetime Value (only projection-based).
Future Research
•	Add churn modeling to refine true LTV.
•	Include cross-device usage and transaction timing patterns.
•	Run sentiment analysis on customer support interactions.
